# Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together
# in any place in the array.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
# [1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
# [0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
# [0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
# The minimum is 1.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
# Example 4:
#
# Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1]
# Output: 8
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= data.length <= 105
# data[i] is 0 or 1.
