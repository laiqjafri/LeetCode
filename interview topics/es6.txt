ES6 refers to version 6 of the ECMA Script (Javascript) programming language. ECMA script is standardized name for
Javascript, and version 6 is the next version after version 5, which was released in 2011. It is a major enhancement
to the Javascript language and adds many more features intended to make large scale software development easier.Javascript

ES6 was published in June 2015. It was subsequently renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Web browser support for ES6 is not yet
complete, though major portions are supported. Major web browsers support some features of ES6. However it is possible
to use software known as transpiler to convert ES6 code into ES5, which is better supported on most browsers.

1. Constants:
const x = 10;

2. Block scoped variables and functions:
With ES6, variables declared using let and const follow block scoping rules just like Java and C++.

3. Arrow functions

4. Default function parameters

5. Rest function parameters

6. String templating

7. Object properties
ES6 brings a simplified object creation syntax e.g. a = {x, y} => {x: ?, y: ?}
Computed property names are quite nifty too e.g. var a = {x, y, ["joe" + y]: 4}

8. Formal class definition syntax

9. Inheritance
