TYPE OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
Both Python and Java are high level programming languages. But Python is an interpreted programming language. The
developers have to use operating system specific Python interpreters to execute the python code directly. They even have
the option to choose from several implementations of programming language. On the other hand, Java is a compiled
programming language. The Java code is compiled in to bytecode that runs on any device or platform with JVM (Java
Virtual Machine). The developers can further port the compiled Java code from one platform to another seamlessly.

PROGRAMMING PARADIGM SUPPORT:
Each of the two programming languages supports a number of commonly used programming paradigms. In addition to being
an object oriented programming language, Python also supports functional, imperative, and procedural programming
paradigms. Java was originally developed as an object oriented, concurrent, and class based programming language. But
it has been evolving consistently. Java 8 treats functions as first class citizens, while supporting key functional
programming concepts like lambdas.

CODE RELIABILITY:
Unlike Java, Python emphasizes explicitly on code reliability. It even enable programmers to keep the code clean,
readable, and concise. Many developers prefer Python to other programming languages to avoid writing additional code,
and keep applications maintainable. Each new version of Java comes with a number of new language features to simplify
software development. Java 9 helps developers to accelerate software development and maintenance by structuring the
software applications with modules. Each module is further designed as a reusable collection of code. But developers
have to put extra time and effort to keep the Java code organized and maintainable.
